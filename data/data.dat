Nomadland vudu hulu amazon-prime-video-us itunes A woman embarks on a journey through the American West after losing everything during the recession. R (Some Full Nudity) Drama Frances McDormand David Strathairn Linda May Swankie Bob Wells Angela Reyes Carl R. Hughes Douglas G. Soul Ryan Aquino Chloé Zhao Chloé Zhao Frances McDormand Peter Spears Mollye Asher Dan Janvey Chloé Zhao Joshua James Richards Chloé Zhao Ludovico Einaudi Joshua James Richards Elizabeth Godar Hannah Peterson Chloe Zhao's Nomadland mimics life scrupulously... What's most striking about Nomadland is the almost incidental manner in which it tells its stories - eschewing strident dramatic crises or narrative lurches for something altogether more ambient. Not since Robert Redford in All Is Lost has a star performer carried an entire film through wordless looks and glances. Frances McDormand delivers a career-best turn in this gently meditative drama about the failure of the American dream. Life on the road has never been so tenderly captured, politically alive and profoundly moving. Personally, I am fine with the more sentimental moments of Nomadland. Social realism needs the space to contain multitudes and contradictions, just as life does. We are terrified by the idea that, as Fern, we might have an incredibly frail appearance of stability. What would we do if life doesn't turn out the way we wanted it to? Nomadland provided the freedom we wanted in 2020. [Full review in Spanish] Beautiful cinematography in an alienating film doesn't have much value... [Nomadland] ends up idealizing an unideal situation. [Full review in Spanish] Featuring one of McDormand's best performances - a role she occupies deeply - and emotionally dissecting the economic terrors of backwater America, 'Nomadland' is one of the best of the year. This warmth and genuine appreciation of people and the many routes they take make Nomadland one of the best movies in Nevada's supply of road pictures. It ultimately reverts to homilies, offering a flinty, exciting character a bland third-act volte-face. Nomadland the movie gets lost in its own drift, and, simply, drops off the map.

Mehta Sev Ohanian Kim Roth Jeff Skoll Niija Kuykendall Sean Bobbitt Kristan Sprague Mark Isham Gifted as Hampton was with rare oratorial skills, the film on his life also tries to spin magic with his words... Impressive, explosive and gut-wrenching. It all adds up to a gripping drama... This is a film made with a sense of outrage; although the events occurred so long ago, the ramifications that they led to are clearly still being felt in the US. As a political statement, Judas is powerful, a quite relevant revisiting of an American past that, as William Faulkner would have observed, isn't even past. Kaluuya is terrific.. A grand historical drama about both practical heroism and tragic cowardice. Lakeith Stanfield, Dominque Fishback and Jesse Plemons are all fantastic in their respective roles, but of course the standout here is Daniel Kaluuya. Get Out alum Lakeith Stanfield works an effective counterpoint to Kaluuya, moving with an ease that seems like the instinctive way a newcomer could insinuate himself into a tight-knit organization. The acting is sensational. Both LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya give knockout performances. Its message and story are tragically timeless, and radicalizing only in their plain honesty about true events. King manages to vindicate these revolutionary figures. As Fred himself said, "You can kill the revolutionary, but you cannot kill the revolution." [Full review in Spanish]
The Father vudu amazon-prime-video-us itunes Anthony (Academy Award Winner, Anthony Hopkins) is 80, mischievous, living defiantly alone and rejecting the carers that his daughter, Anne (Academy Award and Golden Globe Winner, Olivia Colman), encouragingly introduces. Yet help is also becoming a necessity for Anne; she can't make daily visits anymore and Anthony's grip on reality is unraveling. As we experience the ebb and flow of his memory, how much of his own identity and past can Anthony cling to? How does Anne cope as she grieves the loss of her father, while he still lives and breathes before her? THE FATHER warmly embraces real life, through loving reflection upon the vibrant human condition; heart-breaking and uncompromisingly poignant -- a movie that nestles in the truth of our own lives. PG-13 (Thematic Material|Some Strong Language) Drama Anthony Hopkins Olivia Colman Mark Gatiss Imogen Poots Rufus Sewell Olivia Williams Evie Wray Ayesha Dharkar Florian Zeller Christopher Hampton Florian Zeller Philippe Carcassonne Simon Friend Jean-Louis Livi Victor Livi David Parfitt Christophe Spadone Daniel Battsek Lauren Dark Paul Grindey Hugo Grumbar Ben Smithard Yorgos Lamprinos Peter Francis Amanda Dazely Cathy Featherstone Anna Robbins The film seamlessly blends genuine fear with overwhelming sadness. [Anthony Hopkins] is absolutely remarkable here. I read the screenplay, available online, out of curiosity, and what he brings to the words on the page is beyond and beyond and beyond. Hopkins has played King Lear (twice) but this is his real King Lear. The way Zeller and his production designer Peter Francis orchestrate these changes are almost imperceptible, but nevertheless disorienting and utterly crucial to the narrative. Without resorting to exploitative, amped-up mystery or obfuscation, Zeller and co-writer Christopher Hampton have fashioned a sort of gaslight thriller in which the mind is both predator and prey. The Father distorts and disorients in keeping with its protagonist's increasingly confused view of the world. It's a film that disquiets on a cellular level. Director Florian Zeller makes light work of this adaption of his play, using the camera to recreate the claustrophobia and uncertainty of relying on an uncertain mind. Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors alive right now, undoubtedly. The Father was one of the best surprises of 2020, with an incredible visual concept that blows my mind when I think this is Zeller's first film. [Full review in Spanish] [Much] of the strength of the film lies in Anthony Hopkins' lead performance alongside Olivia Colman, Zeller's direction is nothing to sniff at. It's a film that's worth more for its conception and execution than its ideological discourse or social agenda. [Full review in Spanish] Memory is not linear, and 'The Father' captures what it must feel like when memories stop connecting. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his great performances. Hopkins...has never been better. And, given his much garlanded career, that really is saying something.
